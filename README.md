# MATLAB_scripts
A repository for all kinds of MATLAB scripts.

Korelacja- contains a file with data and a MATLAB file, where a signal is loaded from the file, and then two signals are created. Using cross correlation, the signals are found in the given signal.
FiltracjaFFT- contains a MATLAB file, in the file there is a signal consisting of 5 signals (components). Using frequency domain filtering and FFT, one of the components is removed from the signal using Butterworth's bandstop filter.
Odszumianie- contains a file with data and a MATLAB file. In the data, there are two versions of the same signal, one with noise and one without. Firstly, a frequency domain filtering is used on the signal with noise, and then time domain filtering is used in order to remove the noise from the signal. The now commented fragment of the code is used to find the best filters to use.
